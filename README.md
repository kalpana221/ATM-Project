# ATM-Project
Mini project using C ++

this is my first C++ project. As I am always keen to know about learning about computer programming in real life situations so I thought why not we start with an ATM machine functioning (basic) like checking account balance , withdrawal message, remaining balance, updating mobile no., pin etc.

its not a big project as  i wanted to start with a mini one so to get an idea of using C++ in projects.
I'll try to do 3-5 big projects with basic C++ programming to get better on it.
