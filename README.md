# ATM-Project
Mini project using C ++

this is my first C++ project. As I am always keen to know about how one can use computer programming in real life situations so, I started with an ATM machine functioning program project (basic) like checking account balance , withdrawal message, remaining balance, updating mobile no. etc.
